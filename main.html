              First-person shooter <strong>'FPS'</strong> is a sub-genre of shooter video games
              centered on gun and other weapon-based combat in a

                <a href="#">first person perspective.<span><img src="./images/fpsview.jpg" alt="image" height="300"/></span></a></div><br>  The
              player is experiencing the action through the eyes of the protagonist
              and controlling the player character in a three-dimensional
              space.<br />The genre shares common traits with other shooter
              games, and in turn falls under the action game genre.<br />
              Since the genre's inception, advanced 3D and pseudo-3D graphics
              have challenged hardware development, and multiplayer gaming has
              been integral.

            <h2>HISTORY</h2>
            <p>The earliest two documented first-person shooter video games are Maze War and Spasim. 
              Maze War was originally developed in 1973 by Greg Thompson, Steve Colley and Howard Palmer, high-school students in a NASA work-study program trying to develop a program to help visualize fluid dynamics for spacecraft designs.<br>
              The work became a maze game presented to the player in the first-person, and later included support for a second player and the ability to shoot the other player to win the game.<br></br>
              In 1992 Wolfenstein 3d was released and it was an instant success and it has been credited with inventing the first-person shooter genre. 
              It was built on the ray casting technology pioneered in earlier games to create a revolutionary
              template for shooter game design, which first-person shooters are still based upon today.</p>

              Today first-person-shooters are more popular then ever. Some of the leading competitors in the genre today are games like:
