              First-person shooter (FPS) is a sub-genre of shooter video games
              centered on gun and other weapon-based combat in a

                <a href="#">first person perspective<span><img src="./images/fpsview.jpg" alt="image" height="300"/></span></a></div>  The
              player is experiencing the action through the eyes of the protagonist
              and controlling the player character in a three-dimensional
              space.<br />The genre shares common traits with other shooter
              games, and in turn falls under the action game genre.<br />
              Since the genre's inception, advanced 3D and pseudo-3D graphics
              have challenged hardware development, and multiplayer gaming has
              been integral.

            <h2>HISTORY</h2>
            <p>The earliest two documented first-person shooter video games are Maze War and Spasim. 
              Maze War was originally developed in 1973 by Greg Thompson, Steve Colley and Howard Palmer, high-school students in a NASA work-study program trying to develop a program to help visualize fluid dynamics for spacecraft designs.
              The work became a maze game presented to the player in the first-person, and later included support for a second player and the ability to shoot the other player to win the game.
              Thompson took the game's code with him to Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
              where with help from Dave Lebling to create an eight-player version that could be played over ARPANET, 
              computer-run players using artificial intelligence, customizable maps, online scoreboards and a spectator mode. Spasim had a documented debut at the University of Illinois in 1974. The game was a rudimentary space flight simulator for up to 32 players, featuring a first-person perspective.[8] Both games were distinct from modern first-person shooters, involving simple tile-based movement where the player could only move from square to square and turn in 90-degree increments.</p>
